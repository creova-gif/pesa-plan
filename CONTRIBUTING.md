# Contributing

Thanks for contributing. This doc covers what you need to get set up and how to get a change merged.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/creova-gif/maokoto.git
cd maokoto
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Before You Open a Pull Request

1. **Branch from `main`** — use a descriptive branch name, e.g. `fix/login-redirect` or `feat/add-export-button`.
2. **Keep PRs focused** — one logical change per PR. Large, unrelated changes bundled together are hard to review and slow everyone down.
3. **Never commit secrets** — no `.env` files, API keys, or tokens. Check `.gitignore` if you're adding a new config file.
4. **Write a clear PR description** — what changed, why, and how you tested it.

## Code Review

- All PRs require review before merging to `main` — direct pushes to `main` are blocked.
- Address review feedback with new commits rather than force-pushing, so reviewers can see what changed.
- Be responsive to feedback and open to discussion — code review is collaborative, not adversarial.

## Reporting Bugs / Requesting Features

Open a GitHub issue with:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce (for bugs)

## Code Style

- Match the existing code style in the file you're editing.
- Keep functions and components focused — if something's doing too much, it's probably worth splitting up.

## Security

Found a security issue? See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) — don't open a public issue for vulnerabilities.

## Questions

Open an issue or reach out to the maintainer directly if you're unsure where to start.
